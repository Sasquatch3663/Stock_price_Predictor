# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Predictor (LSTM)

This project uses **Yahoo Finance data** and a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network** to predict stock prices.  
It fetches stock data (e.g., Apple - AAPL) and predicts the **next 30 days of closing prices**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetches real stock data using `yfinance`
- Preprocesses data with scaling & time steps
- Builds an LSTM deep learning model
- Predicts **future 30 days of stock prices**
- Plots historical vs predicted prices
